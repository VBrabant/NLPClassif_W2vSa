# Text Classification using Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding

Implementation of [_A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03130.pdf) by Lin et al., 2017. with my own words embedding from an implementation of the W2V CBOW algorithm.

## Data

The implementation is performed on datas available on the [standford university website](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
The dataset can be downloaded [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz) and must be unzipped in the working folder.
